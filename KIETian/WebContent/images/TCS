Technical abilities and skills are not among things which resemble me, I would be last to die on minimal life support. 
As I believe, I am not applying for this job , I am applying for a position in the organization and I guarantee that I will work beyond the level which is expected from that position.

With my unique ideas, unparalleled style of observing  a situation and geared management skills I may be a good match with this role, which I know how to play well.
